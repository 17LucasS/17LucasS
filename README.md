### Hi there 👋
Hello, my name is Lucas and I’m from Poland. Last year I decided to change my career path. I was interested in programming and decided to give it a try. Despite some moments when I wanted to throw my laptop out the window, I continue learning programming and want to develop further in this field. Thanks to programming and tools such as Java, Android Studio, etc., I discovered that you can create almost anything with programming, which is why I'm here. Greetings! 😊
